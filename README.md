RULES
---------------------
X starts first

Wherever X goes in the small tic tac toe box,

O must play in the box relative to the big tic tac toe box

If the opponent sends the player to a board that is already filled or won, 

the player can play in any box that is not filled.

If the small tic tac toe board ends in a draw, then the board is neither an

X or an O
